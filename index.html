    <h1>Beautiful Flowers</h1>

                <h2>Lilac</h2>
                <p>
                    Many count the lilac among their favorite flowers. The bold purple coloring and elegant white outline imbue the flower with a regal look, plus the elongated petals add to the uniqueness of the presentation. There's nothing like a vase of flowers to add a pop of color to your living room, the myriad of colors in a field of wildflowers, or the scent of a fragrant bouquet.

                <p>
                    The iris flower looks as though it was meticulously designed by a skilled artist. Perhaps that’s why it was a favorite subject of Impressionist painter Claude Monet. Splashes of blue, purple, yellow, and white make for a truly unforgettable artistic arrangement.

                <h2>Dahlia</h2>
                <p>
                    The dahlia is one of the lushest and most vibrant flowers you’ll find, available in a rainbow of colors ranging from pink and red to orange or white. Some dahlia petals even have stunning color gradients, like bright reds that gradually fade into soft whites or gorgeous purples that lighten from stem to tip.
